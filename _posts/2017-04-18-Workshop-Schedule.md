## R - Fundamentals of Spatial Data

In this we will focus on some basics of using the R language, reading and writing spatial data in R, dealing with map projections, and the structure of spatial data in R.  We’ll explore ways to work with raster data in R – reading, creating and manipulating raster data – and then we’ll look at some examples of both vector and raster analysis in R such as subsetting, extracting information, and overlaying data using R packages such as sp, sfr, rgdal, raster, and rgeos. This is an introductory workshop – some familiarity with R is ideal but not required.
